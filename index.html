                <p>Digital agencies often like to complicate things so that they alone can be the ones who maintain your project and, thus, bill you for more hours. I believe this fundamentally opposes the best interests of you, the client.</p> 
                    <p>I'm a <a href="http://carlvlew.is">one-person band</a> who answers your phone calls, meets with you face-to-face, and works diligently to understand your needs on an interpersonal level. My goal is provide a simple, customized solution that enables <em>you</em> to take the reigns over your content, but only as soon as you're comfortable with the process. I'll also help teach you at no extra cost after project completion. Check out some of my <a href="http://portfolio.carlvlewis.net">past work.</a></p>

                <h1><b>Innovation via collaboration</b></h1>
                <p class="padded">I can handle most every aspect of your digital project, from prototype to product. But when something can be done faster and cheaper by another local developer or designer, I'm willing to work with them to save you money and get your project finished faster. I won't lie: I'm pretty good at most digital things, but I'm not superman. Nor do I feel threatened by the idea of other developers working with 'my' client; I want you to get the best bang for your buck. I also want to collaborate with you, the client, who I view more as a <em>partner</em> than a customer. Your success is my success. Plain and simple. </p>
                <h1><b>Transparency-first</b></h1>
                <p class="padded">Big agencies almost always require you to pay a hefty retainer fee before they even <em>start</em> work on your project. Then they slap you with an exorbitant final fee based upon billable hours. I do <strong>not</strong> operate on a billable hours fee schedule. Instead, I assess the approximate cost and time needed for your project before we meet to discuss my proposal, let you know the cost <b>on-the-spot</b>, and then leave it up to you to decide whether it's reasonable before signing any contracts. I also endeavor to keep every receipt and track every cost incurred to provide you proof and peace of mind that you're not paying more than you should. </p>
                <h1><b>Locally-sourced, locally-minded</b></h1>
                <p class="padded">I'm based in Savannah, Ga., and think all great things start out local. As such, all locally-owned small businesses (less than 10 employees) will automatically receive 15 percent off services, meaning in most cases you'd be paying almost zero surcharge to me. Sure, I might make less income in the short-run by doing this, but I'm passionate about helping local efforts, and it's worth it to me in the long run to make less money immediately. </p>
                <h1><b>One-person band, 100% risk free</b></h1>
                <p>As an award-winning former digital editor, product manager, interface designer and news app developer, I have more than <a href="http://carlvlewis.net">eight years</a> of experience in creating lasting digital cross-platform brands, products and experiences. I can <em>design</em> and <em>code</em> and <em>brand</em> and develop <em>content strategy</em>. I can communicate clearly, balance project expectations and carry out the art and science of digital brand development. I hold a Master of Science in Digital Media and Data Visualization from <a href="http://columbia.edu">Columbia University in the City of New York</a>, and know the ins and outs of business development as I once led an early-stage startup. If my work fails to meet your expectations, you have the right to ask me to make it work for you at no extra cost. If you're still unhappy, I will refund 100% of the costs to you, which is also in writing in my client agreement contract. </p> <p>Still not sold yet?
